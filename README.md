# SQL-for-Data-Analysis
# 🧠 Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## 📋 Objective
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze employee and department data by writing queries that perform data extraction, aggregation, joining, and optimization.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL (Compatible with: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Any SQL GUI (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DB Browser for SQLite)

## 📁 Files
- `Task 3 SQL for Data Analysis.sql`: Main SQL script containing table creation, data insertion, and various analysis queries.
- `screenshots/`: Folder to upload your query result screenshots (optional for documentation or submission).

## 📊 Features & Query Types Included

### ✅ Table Creation
- `departments` table
- `employees` table

### ✅ Data Manipulation
- Sample data insertion for realistic testing

### ✅ Data Analysis Queries
- **Sorting & Grouping**: `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- **Joins**:
  - `INNER JOIN`: to fetch employees with department names
  - `LEFT JOIN`: to find departments without employees
- **Subqueries**: to identify employees earning above average
- **Aggregate Functions**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`
- **Views**: Created for department-wise salary statistics
- **Indexing**: Optimized queries using `CREATE INDEX`

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Open your preferred SQL tool.
2. Create a new database (optional).
3. Copy and execute the contents of the `.sql` file.
4. Run each query section individually to observe outputs.

## 📸 Sample Screenshot Format (Optional)
You can add screenshots for:
- Top earners
- Department average salaries
- Subquery results
- View creation and usage
- Index creation status

## 🧠 Learnings
This task helped practice:
- Real-world SQL querying patterns
- Performance optimization using indexes
- Logical thinking with joins and subqueries
- Structuring reusable SQL scripts for analysis
